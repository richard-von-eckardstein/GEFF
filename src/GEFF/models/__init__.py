"""
This module contains pre-defined GEF models.

Currently, the following models are implemented:
1. **'classic'**: pure axion inflation
2. **'SE noscale'**: fermionic axion inflation (without accounting for fermion $k$-dependence)
3. **'SE-kh'**: fermionic axion inflation (accounting for fermion $k$-dependence using $k_h$)

Execute these models by calling `GEFF.gef.GEF` with its name and settings.
