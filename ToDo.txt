ModeByMode:
    - Documentation
    - ReadMode
    -  Split ModeByMode Solver and SpecFunctions? 

Tensor:
    - store and load Part
    - split solver and PT? -> Probably PT and GW split

GEF:
    - how to deal with end of inflation Event?
    - How to get Nend when loading data (repurcussions for PT)
    - Better way to track gauge-field indices
    - GEFAlgorithm: less unnecessary attempt trackers
