Long term
---------
GEF:
    - Mode Parser: Check model input for consistency with GEF
    - GEFAlgorithm: less unnecessary attempt trackers

Solver:
    - TimeStep, UpdateVals etc.: more streamlined
    - Better way to track gauge-field indices
    - Event wrappers
    - small things:
        * add convergence error flag
        * add check: thr < convergence error
    - think of better names for settings


MbM:
    - find out when and why MbM can get stuck

General:
    - 
    - Meta classes for consistent class creation? -> seems like overkill



For release
-----------
- Better approach to "heaviside"?
- Parse models before creation? 
- What to do about output? SQL Datenbanken?... Es gibt "eval" in python: str -> function. Reverse?
- gauge field class
- test constants and description
- update docs for constant and description
- rename H0 and MP in BGSys etc.
- rework input to not need dictionaries
- Write arxiv manual
- write read me
- Update PT 
- Add PS
- Settings -> tell user about unkown settings
- move quantities etc description into model header
- sigmaE and B -> alternative for if
