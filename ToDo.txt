GEF:
    - Mode Parser: Check model input for consistency with GEF
    - GEFAlgorithm: less unnecessary attempt trackers

Solver:
    - TimeStep, UpdateVals etc.: more streamlined
    - Better way to track gauge-field indices
    - Event wrappers
    - small things:
        * add convergence error flag
        * add check: thr < convergence error
    - think of better names for settings


MbM:
    - find out when and why MbM can get stuck

General:
    - Documentation!!!
    - Meta classes for consistent class creation? -> seems like overkill
