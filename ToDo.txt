ModeByMode:
    - ReadMode
    - Split ModeByMode Solver and SpecFunctions? 

Tensor:
    - store and load PT

GEF:
    - how to deal with end of inflation Event?
    - How to get Nend when loading data (repurcussions for PT)
    - Better way to track gauge-field indices
    - GEFAlgorithm: less unnecessary attempt trackers
    - Longterm:
        x TimeStep, UpdateVals etc.: more streamlined

General:
    - Documentation
    - New Models
    - File structure
        x Config, GEF, Spec, Tensor File
        x Config knows about settings, GEF, Spec, and Tensor location

SEModesl:
    - treat modelSettings
    - treat ModeEoM
